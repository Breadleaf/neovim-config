# Neovim Config

This is my neovim config! I partially based it off of [ThePrimeagen](https://linktr.ee/ThePrimeagen)'s neovim config.

## Setup

### Installing vim-plug

Run the following command or follow the steps [here](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to install vim-plug.

### Installing my config files

Simply git clone this repo in your `~/.config/` directory.

### Installing all plugins

After the above two steps are complete, open neovim and type `:PlugInstall` to download all packages.

## How to use it?

I have documented most features in the init.lua file in the root of the project. My conventions are to make the binds two letters long for sake of remembering and one if I need to use them alot.
